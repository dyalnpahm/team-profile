# Team-profile


## Description

This is a team profile generator, it was built in order to generate team cards, and display information about the team. It allows users to search up the location of the manager, as well as provide contact inforomation on each employee that is on the team.
I learnt how to use node.js, how to use inquierer and jest.

## Installation

To install this app clone the repo, then install all devDependencies by entering npm i into the terminal.

## Usage
To use this application, open a terminal and enter node index.js to start. The prompts will then appear, enter the team manager's name and details, followed by the employees information. 
After entering all the employees into the generator, go to dist and open live server to few the team!
